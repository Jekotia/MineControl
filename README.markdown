*src/* contains the source scripts used for development and testing, as it is far easier to work on this suite as multiple files instead of one.
The files in *src/* are not recommended for 'production' server use. Use them at your own risk.

See *MineControl-latest.sh* for the latest stable release.

Previous releases will be found in *archive/*.

## Requirements ##

You will need to install:

* busybox (this is responsible for many of the standard *nix commands)

Note that these scripts as a suite MUST be run using **bash**, not sh.
