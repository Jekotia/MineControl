Note that these scripts as a suite MUST be run using bash, not sh.

src/ contains the source scripts used for development and testing, as it is far easier to work on this suite as multiple files instead of one.
The files in src/ are not recommended for 'production' server use. Use them at your own risk.
'Stable' all-in-one bash script files will be found in this repo's 'root' directory when they are ready.
